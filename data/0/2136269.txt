THE ANTIMYCOBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF VARIOUS AMINES RELATED TO SPERMINE IN CHEMICAL STRUCTURE

 A final concentration of 3 x 10–5 M spermine or spermidine inhibited the growth of mammalian tubercle bacilli in a modified Dubos liquid medium. Various related amino compounds, including isolated portions of the spermine molecule and the products of its chemical degradation, did not manifest similar antimycobacterial activity.
