Cancer in Northern Ireland by 2002.

An estimate of cancer deaths and incidence for the years 1997 and 2002, taking account of current trends and population projections for Northern Ireland is presented below. These numbers will be of value to those planning services and, in particular, for those implementing the report "Cancer Services - Investing for the Future". Cancer deaths are expected to rise by almost 13% to 4056 by the year 2002. Marked rises are expected in the number of deaths from cancer of the lung, oesophagus, kidney, bladder and prostate with smaller rises in deaths from breast and pancreatic cancer. The fall in stomach cancer is expected to continue as is the trend of lower deaths from cervical cancer. Deaths from cancer of the colon and rectum are expected to remain static. Estimates of cancer incidence currently and for the years 1997 and 2002 are also included. The impact of tobacco use by the population, which poses a current and future serious threat to public health is highlighted.
